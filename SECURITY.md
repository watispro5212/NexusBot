## Security Architecture

Nexus Protocol implements the following security measures:

### Bot-Level Security
- **Owner Gate** — Root commands restricted to a single hardcoded user ID
- **Blacklist System** — Severed operatives cannot use any bot functions
- **Cooldown Engine** — Per-command, per-user rate limiting prevents abuse
- **Guild-Only Lock** — All commands blocked in DMs
- **Module Toggles** — Server admins can disable entire categories (economy, casino, fun, leveling)
- **Anti-Spam & Anti-Link Detection** — Auto-moderation for message flooding and unauthorized URLs
- **Audit Logging** — Tracks message deletions and edits globally protecting community transparency
- **Starboard Sanitization** — Starboard cache mitigates spamming of starboard logs
- **Bad Word Filter** — Configurable per-server word blacklist
- **Error Isolation** — Double try-catch pattern prevents command crashes from killing the bot
- **Memory Leak Prevention** — Automatic pruning of expired tracking data
- **Input Validation** — Discord.js slash command option types enforce input constraints

### Infrastructure Security
- **Environment Variables** — Tokens and credentials stored in `.env`, never committed
- **Sharded Architecture** — Isolated shard processes prevent cascade failures
- **MongoDB Authentication** — Secure connection string with Atlas TLS
- **Graceful Error Handling** — `unhandledRejection` and `uncaughtException` catches
